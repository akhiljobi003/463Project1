**Overview
*The Financial Data Analysis System is a Python-based project designed to address the challenge of efficiently analyzing large
financial datasets, such as stock prices, transaction logs, or cryptocurrency data. The system aims to provide rapid, scalable
analysis of financial time series data, enabling users to identify trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions in the
fast-paced world of finance. Key goals include efficient processing and sorting of large datasets, identification of trends and
patterns, detection of anomalies that may indicate fraud or market irregularities, and generation of actionable insights through
comprehensive reports. The system is specifically tailored to work with time series financial data, represented as tuples of 
(timestamp, value) for flexibility across different financial instruments. It employs divide-and-conquer techniques, including
Merge Sort for efficient data sorting (O(n log n) time complexity), a divide-and-conquer implementation of Kadane's Algorithm
for finding periods of maximum gain or loss, and a divide-and-conquer Closest Pair of Points algorithm for anomaly detection.
These algorithm choices reflect the need for both efficiency and accuracy when dealing with potentially massive financial 
datasets, allowing the system to provide timely insights even as the volume of financial data continues to grow.
